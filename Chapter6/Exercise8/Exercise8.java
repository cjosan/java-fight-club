//        (Parking Charges) A parking garage charges a $2.00 minimum fee to park for up to three
//        hours. The garage charges an additional $0.50 per hour for each hour or part thereof in excess of three
//        hours. The maximum charge for any given 24-hour period is $10.00. Assume that no car parks for
//        longer than 24 hours at a time. Write an application that calculates and displays the parking charges
//        for each customer who parked in the garage yesterday. You should enter the hours parked for each
//        customer. The program should display the charge for the current customer and should calculate and
//        display the running total of yesterdayâ€™s receipts. It should use the method calculateCharges to determine
//        the charge for each customer.
